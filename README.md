# Todoey âœ“

## My Goal

The objective of this project is to understand how to save data in iOS. I'll look at various choices and learn to use UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm.


## What will be created

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.
 This will help solidify my knowledge on basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as data persistence using User Defaults, Core Data and Realm Swift.
